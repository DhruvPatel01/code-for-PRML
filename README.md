# What is this repository?

I have started reading 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning' by Bishop again, and this time I plan to finish it :). Since this time I am not in hurry (due to no upcoming exams etc), I plan to code as I progress through the book. These notebooks will contain code to generate plots that are similar to the ones in Bishop's book. I have started learning Julia language, so as I progress through, I might change the laungage from Python to Julia, as part of my learning experience.

# Aren't there already repositories for Bishop's book?
Yes there are. I just wanted to learn libraries, language and stuff along the way, so I am probably reinventing the wheel. I am not sure that this will be even completed. [Here](https://github.com/ctgk/PRML) is one such repo. Kevin Murhpy also has written some code that generates Bishop's figures or likes of it for his book 'Probabilistic Machine Learning'. Earlier this code was written is some obscure proprietary programming language, but it is in the process of being migrated to Python. You can access it [here](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml).
